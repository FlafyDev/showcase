# Showcase Mod

This mod adds an auto-complete button to rated levels. When pressed, the mod will automatically play and complete the level for you, similar to how auto levels work in the game.

Additionally, when you complete rated levels that don't yet have an auto button, your keystrokes will be recorded and sent to the mod's servers. After verification, these recordings will create new auto buttons that become available for both you and other players using the mod.

In the future, keystrokes will also be sent to the server when practice mode is enabled. Currently this feature is disabled.
